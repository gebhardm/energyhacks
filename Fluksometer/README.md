# Fluksometer Additions

This folder contains stuff I made during my times of operating a
Fluksometer (FLM), a neat little appliance to do energy metering and display.

Refer to https://www.flukso.net/ for more details; the project seems abandoned.

As I also moved out of an environment where I could use the FLM "on premise",
this folder's content is mainly for the records and whomever wants to catch
up with some ideas spread in the respective community "that time".
