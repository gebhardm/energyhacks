An MQTT-panel adaptation to the flukso.net Fluksometer.
"serve_panel.js" is a JavaScript running on node.js. It serves as
a MQTT message to socket.io pipe with an integrated simple http
server. The provided page (index.html) displays data of all retrieved
FLM sensor gauges; the panel.html includes the counters also.

How to use
==========
To run the script install node.js; easiest from http://github.com/joyent/node.
Install node.js using the command sequence
"git checkout v0.10.28-release", "./configure",  "make" and "sudo make install".

Install the MQTT and socket.io modules with "npm install mqtt socket.io".
ATTENTION: socket.io has incompatibly changed between v0.9 and v1.0 - this panel
version does work with the v0.9 only; there is a new repository where I will
keep up with the evolution of the different modules; thus, this repo will stay
as it is... See http://github.com/gebhardm/flmdisplay

On a running node.js installation just run the ./panel.sh script to start
the server - be aware to adapt the MQTT client address in the serve_panel.js
to your local FLM's address.
Point your wherever located browser to the web server's IP address port 1080,
in my example http://192.168.0.70:1080 - the index.html page is loaded
automatically; for the panel.html file use http://<address>:1080/panel.html
Have fun.
